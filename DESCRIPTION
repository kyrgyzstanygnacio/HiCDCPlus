Title: Hi-C Direct Caller Plus
Version: 0.99.14
Description: Systematic 3D interaction calls and differential analysis for Hi-C and HiChIP. The HiC-DC+ (Hi-C/HiChIP direct caller plus) package enables principled statistical analysis of Hi-C and HiChIP data sets – including calling significant interactions within a single experiment and performing differential analysis between conditions given replicate experiments – to facilitate global integrative studies. HiC-DC+ estimates significant interactions in a Hi-C or HiChIP experiment directly from the raw contact matrix for each chromosome up to a specified genomic distance, binned by uniform genomic intervals or restriction enzyme fragments, by training a background model to account for random polymer ligation and systematic sources of read count variation.
