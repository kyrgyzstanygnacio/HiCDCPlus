To explore the basics of the HiCDCPlus package, we have included five Hi-C samples in .hic format extracted from GSE63525 and GSE131651 for human chromosomes 21 and 22, an index file suitable as an input for hicdcdiff (GSE131651_analysis_indices.txt.gz) for use with GSE131651 .hic files, and a bintolen file example (test_bintolen.txt.gz) compatible for use with the example provided in ?generate_bintolen_gi_list

If you have installed this package, you can obtain the directory where these samples, index file example and bintolen file example are with the command:

hic_sampledata_dir <- system.file("extdata", package = "HiCDCPlus")
